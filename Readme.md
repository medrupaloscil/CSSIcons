# Medrupaloscil's Icons

Hi ! This is a bunch of icons entirely made of CSS, you can change their size simply by changing their parent's font size. You can also choose their color simply by changing their parent's color !


# How to

Well, you just need to import the **"mi-style.css"** file into your project aaaand it's done ! You just need to add the right class to an i tag.

`<i class="mi-[icon name]"></i>`

`<i class="mi-[icon name] empty"></i>`

>And what if I need an icon that's not in the file ?

You can contact me by mail (in my bio), feel free to ask anything (but more icons are obviously coming) !
